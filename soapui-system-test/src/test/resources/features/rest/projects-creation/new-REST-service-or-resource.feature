  In order to get new service or resource added easily in a SoapUI REST project
  As Calvin
  I want to only paste the URI or path to add the new service or resource

Scenario:
# TODO
# add new REST service ---right click the project name          same as create REST project
# add new resource    ---right click the REST service name      SoapUI show the endpoint before
# add new children resource ---right click the resource name    SoapUI show the endpoint and resources before
